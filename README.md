Your task
Write a program that prints one line for each number from 1 to 100
For multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number
For the multiples of five print Buzz instead of the number
For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz instead of the number

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15,
1,2,fizz, 4, buzz, fizz, 7, 8, fizz, buzz, 11, fizz, 13, 14, fizzbuzz
if the number is divisible by 3 -> fizz,
if the number is divisible by 5 -> buzz,

extending the rules a little

2nd step
Numbers divisible by 7 return pop
Numbers divisible by 2 return fuzz
3rd step
You can define any rule you want, for example: numbers divisible by 4 return pep or whatever you want
